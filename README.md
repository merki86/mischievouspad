Play any sound through your mic.

## Using
Rename your sound file to `audio.mp3` and put it in the root directory of the program. The sound will be played once, to repeat you have to restart the program.

### Important
You have to reselect your input and output devices to any virtual cables that would be able to retranslate audio the program produce so that you will able to play it through your mic. \
It's the limitation of [hajimehoshi/oto](https://github.com/hajimehoshi/oto) that you can't select a device audio by yourself. \
I don't wanna try to rewrite this using PortAudio. Hell no.
